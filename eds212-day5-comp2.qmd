```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

## Some logical operators

-   == (does this match?)

-   != (do these not match?)

-   \>, \<, \>=, \<=

-   &, \|

```{r}

4 == 5 # does 4 equal 5?

4 == 4 # does 4 match 4?

4 != 5 # does 4 not match 5?

4 == "4" # does 4 match "4"?

# with assigned variables:
cat <- 10
dog <- 7

cat > dog # is cat greater than dog?

# Is dog greater than cat, OR is cat less than 20?
dog > cat | cat < 20 # OR statement asks if one of them is true

# Is dog less than cat AND cat == 10
dog < cat & cat == 10

dog < cat & cat > 2 & 4 >= dog
```

```{r}
# need to load the tidyverse in order to use ggplot2
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point(aes(size = mpg, color = wt)) + labs(x = "Car Weight (1000 pounds)", y = "Gas Mileage (mpg)", title = "Car weight efficiency relationship")
```
